# wwbm-genesis

**(WWBM) Who want to be a millionaire** - this app is a quiz game based on the famous game "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" The player is given 12 questions and 4 answers to each of them. To win the game, you need to answer all the questions correctly.

I made up the questions myself. I hope you find them interesting. Please don't judge me harshly 🤷‍♂️
